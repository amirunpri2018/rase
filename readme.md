# RASE supplement

This repository contains supplementary information to the following manuscript:
*Lineage calling can identify antibiotic resistant clones within minutes*

## Structure

* **rase-pipeline-results**: Results of the RASE pipeline for all experiments from the paper (SP01-SP12). The `prediction`, `plots`, and `benchmarks` subdirectories contain prediction time tables, the resulting plots (rank plots for `t=1m, 5m, last m` and timeline plot for each experiment), and Snakemake benchmarks (time and memory used for individual steps of the pipeline).
* **lab-notebooks**: Lab notebooks for sequencing isolates (SP01-SP06) and additional MIC testing

Other directories will appear in the next days.

## Other data

Sequencing reads are available from http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1405173.
